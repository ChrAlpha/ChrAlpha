Hi, nice to meet you! This is  ChrAlpha, a current student from China as well as a budding open source contributor. Coding for fun.

Once I have had special training for OI. Recently I am trying to study front-end on my own by building  my own [Hexo](https://hexo.io) theme — [Cards](https://github.com/ChrAlpha/hexo-theme-cards).

Even though I am under the pressure of schoolwork, I also like to share something interesting or useful on my [blog](https://blog.ichr.me ) (zh-CN) in my spare time.
